First tried a smaller LSTM model wherein my input data is just agent 0's input and it's corresponding output.
Window size is X is 40 and Y is  10 .. so 40:10 X and Y..

but this kept me thinking as for this using LSTM I can only push 0th agent into training, and just discarding rest of the 
agents data

so what to do.. doesn't attention come in mind ?

what i can do is, input from all the 50 agents gives output to just 0th agent, hence the attention will remodulate
itself in sucha a way that the amount of focus from each agent will be specified to just that single output
